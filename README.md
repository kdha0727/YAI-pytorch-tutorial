# Pytorch tutorial in YAI Academy

**Term: YAI 2021 summer session**

---

## 1st Week

* Implements Multi Layer Perceptron, by using not abstract Module class, but Variable (=Tensor).

* Implements forward pass and backward pass of graph, from scratch.

* Uses raw MNIST Dataset.

---

## 2nd Week

* Implements MLP by using abstract layers and subclassing Module class.

* Implements commonly-used activation layers, such as ReLU, Sigmoid, LeakyReLU, PReLU, SiLU and ELU, from scratch.

* Designs and implements custom activation layer.

* Uses raw MNIST Dataset.

---

## 3rd Week

* Implements LeNet5 Module by oneself.

* Implements training, evaluating and testing function: [link here][easyrun].

* Uses and simply preprocesses FashionMNIST Dataset.

---

## 4th Week

* Implements ResidualBlock and Resnet Module by oneself, and builds resnet34.

* Implements training, evaluating and testing function: [link here][easyrun].

* Visualizes fitting losses and accuracies.

* Uses and applies data augmentation to CIFAR10 Dataset.

---

## (Note) 5th and 6th week

* Project: **[Lung Opacity and COVID-19 Chest Radiography Classification and Detection by FasterRCNN with EfficientNet Backbone][project]**
